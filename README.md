# 2048
This repo is my version of 2048 game.

### How to play?
Use the arrow keys to play. 
* When the game begins there will be two numbers in random cells.
* When you hit a certain arrow all the numbers that have empty cell next to them will move to the empty cell in that direction.
* If there are more than one empty cell it will move to the final empty cell in that direction
