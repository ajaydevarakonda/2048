# 2048
This repo is my version of 2048 game.

### How to play?
Use the arrow keys to play. 
1. When the game begins there will be two numbers in random cells.
2. When you hit a certain arrow all the numbers that have empty cell next to them will move to the empty cell in that direction.
3. If there are more than one empty cell it will move to the final empty cell in that direction
4. If there is a number same as the number right next to it or far away from it with nothing but empty cells between them, and you hit the direction key in that same direction, they will combine to produce a new cell that is twice the value of the current cell. The new cell of course will move to the final empty cell in the same direction.
5. Game ends if all the cells are full or if you achieve 2048, if you achieve 2048 you win, else you lose if the game ends.
